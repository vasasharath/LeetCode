/*
Given a string s, determine if it is valid.

A string s is valid if, starting with an empty string t = "", you can transform t into s after performing the following operation any number of times:

Insert string "abc" into any position in t. More formally, t becomes tleft + "abc" + tright, where t == tleft + tright. Note that tleft and tright may be empty.
Return true if s is a valid string, otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aabcbc"
Output: true
Explanation:
"" -> "abc" -> "aabcbc"
Thus, "aabcbc" is valid.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcababcc"
Output: true
Explanation:
"" -> "abc" -> "abcabc" -> "abcabcabc" -> "abcabcababcc"
Thus, "abcabcababcc" is valid.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abccba"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to get "abccba" using the operation.
Example 4:

Input: s = "cababc"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to get "cababc" using the operation.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 104
s consists of letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'

var isValid = function(S) {
    while(S.indexOf("abc") != -1){
        S=S.replace(/abc/g, "");
    }
    return S == ""
